<h1>The Best Movies According to Ege</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Prestige</h3>
<p>
  This movie is truly my number one. It's a movie that really makes you think,
  and every detail, from the plot to the actors, was magnificent.
</p>
<h3>Ayla</h3>
<p>
  This movie was truly emotional. It has a great significance for us Turks. It's
  impossible not to cry.
</p>
<h3>The Fast and Furious Series</h3>
<p>
  This movie is really good in terms of action. Yes, the events are unrealistic
  and this is too much for you to believe, but it's a hit for car enthusiasts.
