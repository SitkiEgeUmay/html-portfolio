<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I'm Sitki Ege Umay, a third-year student in the Information Systems
  Engineering program at Muğla Sitki Koçman University. I live in İzmir, and I'm
  truly happy to be here—I consider myself quite lucky. I love riding
  motorcycles, playing the electric guitar, discovering new places, and
  socializing. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends or learning
  something new.
</p>

<p>
  I'd also like to share a bit about Muğla. Compared to İzmir, it's a smaller
  city with more limited activities, especially during the fall semester when
  things tend to be quieter. However, if you have good friends to spend time
  with, this isn't much of an issue. The spring semester, on the other hand, is
  full of life. Thanks to its proximity to popular holiday destinations like
  Akyaka, Marmaris, Fethiye, and Bodrum, Muğla offers great opportunities for
  weekend getaways and fun experiences.
</p>

<p>
  In the future, I aim to improve myself in the field of software development
  and work in an enjoyable, collaborative environment with people I love. I want
  to solve problems together, have fun, and—most importantly—see my work not as
  a burden, but as a passion. One of my biggest dreams is to live abroad;
  currently, the countries I'm most interested in are the Netherlands and
  Germany. As I continue to grow and develop, I’ll be working on new projects
  and sharing my journey here with you.
